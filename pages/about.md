Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Graduated with a degree in Economics from the University of Guanajuato, with hands-on experience in the public sector at the Secretary of Finance of the State of Guanajuato and the State Sports Commission. Skilled in critical analysis, adaptability, collaborative teamwork, proactive decision-making, and leveraging data-driven insights.
